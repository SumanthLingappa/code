Chowka Bara (ಚೌಕ-ಬಾರ) or Asta Chama is a popular (board) game in the hinterlands of India

During the Coronavirus lockdown, we wanted to play this game. However we didnt have the dice required. So I had written this small script which simuated dice.

More info about the game:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chowka_bhara

There is lot to improve. In a very short span of time(5 mins), I had to write this script.

__**What can be improved:**__
- Relative co-ordinates
- configurable number of dice
